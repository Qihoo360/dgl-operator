# DGL Operator

The DGL Operator makes it easy to run Deep Graph Library (DGL) graph neural network distributed or non-distributed training on Kubernetes. Please check out [here](https://www.dgl.ai/) for an introduction to DGL and [dgl distributed training](https://docs.dgl.ai/guide/distributed.html) philosophy.

## ðŸ› Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.16

## ðŸš€Installation
You can deploy the operator with default settings by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Qihoo360/dgl-operator
cd dgl-operator
kubectl create -f deploy/v1alpha1/dgl-operator.yaml
```

You can check whether the DGL Job custom resource is installed via:
```
kubectl get crd
```

The output should include `dgljobs.qihoo.net` like the following:
```
NAME                                       AGE
...
dgljobs.qihoo.net                          1m
...
```

## ðŸ”¬Creating a DGL Job
You can create a DGL job by defining an DGLJob config file. See [graphsage-cpu.yaml](https://github.com/Qihoo360/dgl-operator/blob/master/examples/v1alpha1/graphsage-cpu.yaml) example config file for launching a multi-node GraphSAGE training job. You may change the config file based on your requirements.

```
cat examples/v1alpha1/graphsage-cpu.yaml
```

Deploy the DGLJob resource to start training:
```
kubectl create -f examples/v1alpha1/graphsage-cpu.yaml
```
